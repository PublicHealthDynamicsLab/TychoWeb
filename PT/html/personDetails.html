				<p>I am a principal investigator of Project Tycho since its inception in 2013. I am an assistant professor in the Departments of Epidemiology and Biomedical Informatics 
				at the University of Pittsburgh and an affiliate faculty of the Public Health Dynamics Laboratory. I received my MD at the Free University Amsterdam and my PhD in 
				Global Disease Epidemiology from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. My research program at the intersection of data science and public health is 
				focused on improving the efficient use of information for public health action. I have led research on the collection, curation, and integration of disease surveillance
				 data for all notifiable diseases in the United States from 1888 to the present, as part of Project Tycho development. We used this extensive US dataset to demonstrate 
				 that childhood vaccination prevented 100 million cases of serious childhood diseases (NEJM, New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal). More recently, 
				 my team completed research on the integration and analysis of dengue surveillance data from eight Southeast Asia countries, resulting in the discovery of an association
				  between high temperatures and dengue dynamics across all countries (PNAS, NIH Directorâ€™s Blog).  I am also funded by the NIH Big Data to Knowledge program to work
				   on improving methods for population health informatics, in particular representing global health data in a machine-interpretable format, towards compliance with 
				   FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) compliance. In addition, I am funded by the US NIH as project PI of the Models of Infectious Disease Agents 
				   Study (MIDAS) Center of Excelence and by the Gates Foundation as project lead of the Vaccine Modeling Initiative (VMI). Finally, I coordinate an outreach program on 
				   global health data and computational epidemiology funded by the Benter Foundation in Pittsburgh and various industry sponsors. At the University of Pittsburgh, 
				   I lecture on infectious disease epidemiology, global health, and teach a graduate class in vaccine epidemiology. I am also involved in developing a Data Science 
				   curriculum at the at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health.  I enjoy cooking, drinking wine, sailing, and spending time in nature.  </p>
